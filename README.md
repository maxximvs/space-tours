## How I worked on this project

With this project, I set out to simulate a professional, although in its scope, rudimentary workflow.

- I sketched out a basic style direction in Figma
- I also tried to organize the tasks on Trello
- Finally I tracked my progress on Github

## What it is about

In this project, I tried to illustrate using some of the most common features of CSS, React and Firebase.

- The project is a mockup web app for a company specializing in space tourism
- It utilizes CSS Modules with a responsive design for multiple screen sizes
- React to manage state and routing
- Firebase to handle authentication and store / retrieve user data like login credentials and booked journeys

## What I would continue working on

Now that the project is in a presentable state, I would change or keep working on the following things:

- Plan the design more thoroughly. As it is a practice project, I felt like I was coming up with some design decisions on the go. In hindsight, I would try to lay it out more systematically.
- Rework some of the CSS code, especially code that I could've used in a more efficient way.
- JavaScript logic that could be handled more efficiently.
- And eventually rewrite the project using TypeScript.

I haven't changed anything in the original readme, you can find it right below this.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
